# Implementing-route-planner
Abstract: As for autonomous cars to navigate in a optimal way from start location to end location, it needs to select the path which has the optimal cost value. With that motivation, in this project I learnt implementing A* search algorithm for route plannning. 
The pipeline for the project:
1. Defining a map and loading a map.
2. Writing A* algorithm. 
3. Defining start and location for the algorithm.
4. Evaluation of algorithm.
